find 1 (length 2)
find 7 (length 3)
find 4 (length 4)
compare 1 and 7 and find the letter that is in 7 that isn't in 1
map that missing letter to A

find every letter of length 6
in those strings, find the one that has 3 of the same character that are in 4 (this is 0)

in the zero string, find the string that IS in 4 that isn't in 1 and map it to D

go back to 4, and find the rune that isn't in one, nor is the new found character that is mapped to D
Map this rune to B

find a string of length 6 that does contain the ORIGINAL rune that we mapped at D AND that does NOT contain all
all the characters that are in 1 (this is 6)

find the character that is in one, that ISN'T in 6 and map it to C. Map the other character
In one, find the character that was just mapped to C and map the other one to F

Find the character that is of length 6 that ISN't 6 NOR 0, (this is 9)
In 9, find the only character that is in there, that we haven't mapped yet and map it to G
Map the remaining character to E

//loop through the 4 digits and add them to a string + convert to int and this is the result for that line
repeat the same process for other lines and add the output to the sum
this is the final result
